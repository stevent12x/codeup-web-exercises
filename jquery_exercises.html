<h1 id="morbo">Morbo can't understand his teleprompter because he forgot how you say that letter that's shaped like a man wearing a hat.</h1>
    <p>I'm sure those windmills will keep them cool. Why did you bring us here? Good news, everyone! There's a report on TV with some very bad news! Hi, I'm a naughty nurse, and I really need someone to talk to. $9.95 a minute.</p>
    <p>You're going to do his laundry? Who said that? SURE you can die! You want to die?! Throw her in the brig. <strong> Maybe I love you so much I love you no matter who you are pretending to be.</strong> <em class="codeup"> We need rest.</em> The spirit is willing, but the flesh is spongy and bruised.</p>
<h2>I'm just glad my fat, ugly mama isn't alive to see this day.</h2>
   <div class="div">
       <p>We can't compete with Mom! Her company is big and evil! Ours is small and neutral! You guys go on without me! I'm going to go… look for more stuff to steal! Of all the friends I've had… you're the first.</p>
   </div>
        <ol class="codeup">
            <li>Hello Morbo, how's the family?</li>
            <li>Yes, except the Dave Matthews Band doesn't rock.</li>
            <li>We need rest. The spirit is willing, but the flesh is spongy and bruised.</li>
        </ol>

<h3>Too much work. Let's burn it and say we dumped it in the sewer.</h3>
    <p>Yes, if you make it look like an electrical fire. When you do things right, people won't be sure you've done anything at all. Of all the friends I've had… you're the first. Bender?! You stole the atom.</p>
        <div>
        <ul class="list">
            <li>Now, now. Perfectly symmetrical violence never solved anything.</li>
            <li>Kids have names?</li>
            <li>Hey, you add a one and two zeros to that or we walk!</li>
        </ul>
        </div>
    <p>Now what? But, like most politicians, he promised more than he could deliver. Bender, you risked your life to save me! Bender, being God isn't easy. If you do too much, people get dependent on you, and if you do nothing, they lose hope. You have to use a light touch. Like a safecracker, or a pickpocket.</p>
    <p>Stop it, stop it. It's fine. I will 'destroy' you! I had more, but you go ahead. Bender?! You stole the atom. But existing is basically all I do!</p>
    <p id="codeup">Yeah, lots of people did. I saw you with those two "ladies of the evening" at Elzars. Explain that. You've killed me! Oh, you've killed me! Doomsday device? Ah, now the ball's in Farnsworth's court! I usually try to keep my sadness pent up inside where it can fester quietly as a mental illness.</p>
    <p>And why did 'I' have to take a cab? You wouldn't. Ask anyway! Oh right. I forgot about the battle. Well I'da done better, but it's plum hard pleading a case while awaiting trial for that there incompetence.</p>
