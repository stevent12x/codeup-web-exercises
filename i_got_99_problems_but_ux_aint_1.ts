// I Got 99 Problems But UX Ain't One
//
//
// 1.) Issue: Horrible restaurant POS (point-of-sale) systems that cause frustration rather than streamline the process of placing orders.
//     Solution: An app that allows for easy BOH communication, customizable page organization and layout, and OTF modification of CC payments.
//
//
// 2.) Issue: San Antonio's VIA transport app.
//     Solution: A mobile app paired with onboard GPS systems that update regularly and properly communicate information to the user.
//
//
// 3.) Issue: Birds aren't real.
//     Solution: A mobile app that allows the user to take pictures of any and all "birds" in the area and automatically reports them to the proper authorities.
